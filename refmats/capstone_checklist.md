- **Summary**
    You have the rest of Foundations to work on this (minus time to record a demo video).
    You need to plan before you code.
    Your app should have at least 3 main features and a styled, interactive front end thatâ€™s connected to a back end.
    You need to score at least 70 points to pass.
    You will be presenting these projects at the end of Foundations.
